My only goal now is to find a job. Looking at your fellow students, you realize that you missed too much. I looked at vacancies in my city and there were a lot of JS and stuff. I liked web-development and moving on his direction.
Little experience in languages such as C++,C#,Java,Python but right now im started learned HTML/CSS/JS

I haven't working experience , I only making projects for myself and push them on git
I tried ofline courses by IntexSoft (JS,JAVA) but didnâ€™t make it to the end
I learned English only at school and keeping practice by kinda tests, like yours). I'm at A2-B1 level right now.
